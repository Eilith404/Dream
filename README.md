    <p><em>Just like in the dream... simple moments from the last few days.</em></p>

    <h2>â˜• Morning Coffee</h2>
    <p>You were telling me a story while I was drinking coffee, you had a cup of green tea. The sunlight made everything feel slow and warm.</p>

    <h2>ðŸ›’ Grocery Run</h2>
    <p>We argued over which wine is the best. I let you win, of course.</p>

    <h2>ðŸŽ® Gaming</h2>
    <p>We finally found an opened cyber coffee to play Overwatch. You saved me with a Zarya bubble, but after that I let you die because I was distracted with a cute frog on the map (sorry! >_<).</p>

    <h2>ðŸŒ† Walking back home</h2>
    <p>We walked past bright lights and noisy ads. The city felt loud and fast, but being with you made it feel calm and slow.</p>

    <p>Thanks for downloading this emotional DLC.</p>
